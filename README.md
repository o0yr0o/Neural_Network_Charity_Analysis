# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use not for profit dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the charitable organization, Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- The `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column is the target for the model since it contains binary data which can indicate whether the charity donation was used effectively.
- The `EIN` and `NAME` are dropped from the dataset because they are the identification columns and have no value to the model.
- The `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, `ASK_AMT` are the feautres for the model.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- 

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 


Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
